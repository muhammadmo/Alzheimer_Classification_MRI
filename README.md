# Alzheimer_Classification_MRI
This study proposes an automated Alzheimer's disease stage detection system using image processing and deep learning. The paper leverages three advanced CNN architectures (Inception, InceptionResNet, and Xception) for MRI image classification, trained on a subset of the widely-used ADNI dataset.
